"it does indeed work :) thanks! Could please explain why you need *(float**)? I understand that (float**) is casting addr as a pointer to a pointer to which you then dereference. But since addr holds the address of newValue, isnt addr just like a pointer, hence you only need to cast it as float* and dereference that? That doesnt work but I dont understand why. What am I missing?",Russel West,100
"This partially solved the problem. Now the problem seems to be that he can't find ""s1"", ""s2""... and so on, since they are on the main XAML. But great help anyway!",Bruno Schweller,100

i am using IIS 5.1,sona,100
"while(running) {
                    Socket incoming = rcvlistener.accept();
                    new ConnectionHandler(incoming);
                }

That's certainly possible, but the ConnectionHandler class is starting a new thread to handle the incoming connection and then the while loop goes back to waiting for a new connection. I could try manually increasing the backlog of the ServerSocket to see if that makes a difference.",thodinc,100

These classes encapsulate state-full objects and provide mutators on them. There exists no client simply because this project is a simulation experiment. Apart from initial initialization of the simulation variables nothing else changes in the programs parameters after that. It just runs to completion and produces results. The 8 classes represent objects with discrete responsibilities that must work together to produce something like the main routine in a serial program written in C in order for the simulation to function.,imoschak,100
